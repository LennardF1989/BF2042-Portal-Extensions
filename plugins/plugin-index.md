# Plugin Manager Index
A curated list of all known plugin managers, sorted by alphabet. Create an Issue to have yours added to this list.

> NOTE! The default Plugin Manager is always loaded as part of the [extension manifest](https://github.com/LennardF1989/BF2042-Portal-Extensions/blob/master/dist/manifest.json) and cannot be replaced. However, since a Plugin Manager is just a plugin, you can let the default Plugin Manager load another one.
